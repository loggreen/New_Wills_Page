				<h1 class="main_header">The Two Main Types of Elder Abuse Cases</h1>
				<h5 class="heading_description">There are generally two types of elder abuse cases that we see, medical malpractice and general negligence cases. 

				Traditionally, these cases have fallen under the category of medical malpractice because an elderly person is receiving some type of medical care, whether that be in some type of nursing home or through home healthcare. If a physician, or what the law calls a Qualified Healthcare Provider, falls below the standard of care, then they may have committed medical malpractice. Then if the healthcare provider is a part of the patient’s compensation fund, then the case must go before a panel of doctors and these physicians determine whether or not malpractice was committed. Then the case may proceed through the courts. 

				Generally anything that does not fall under the medical malpractice category is going to be considered a general negligence case. The main thing to remember about a negligence case is that the word negligence derives from the word neglect. These cases involve any type of situation where one party has neglected another party and they should not have. What we see is that this can involve anyone who is involved in providing services to the elderly. That is a broad range of companies and can include companies involved in transport, preparing meals, home health care attendants and even just sitters. Those organizations all owe a basic duty to the person they are providing services for, and when that organization breaches that duty then there is a case. The breach can be very simple. Perhaps someone is meant to be a sitter for 24 hours and was only there for half of the day, or they were there but fell asleep. Finally, there must be some type of damages involved in order for there to be a successful case.</h5>

				<h1 class="main_header">Who Can Commit Elder Abuse?</h1>
				<h5 class="heading_description">We are often asked who is an elder abuse case against? Does it have to be a nursing home? The answer is no, it can be against any person or organization that provides service to the elderly. It can be as broad as that and there are many companies that fall under that category. Helpful examples can be hospitals, nursing homes, sitters, transportation companies and meal preparers, but basically it can be any company that aids the elderly.</h5>

				<h1 class="main_header">Elder Abuse & Estate Law Issues</h1>
				<h5 class="heading_description">Oftentimes when we are talking about elder abuse cases, the elder person can be incapacitated. They can either not have their mental faculties or not be able to speak for themselves. In that situation, a critical question for us as the attorneys is who can institute the lawsuit on behalf of the victim. If someone has a power of attorney, then potentially that person could pursue the lawsuit on the victim’s behalf. We would have to review the power of attorney to confirm what authority it gives. Alternatively, an interdiction always grants that authority. The interdiction, sometimes called a guardianship in other states, gives an individual the legal authority to act on another’s behalf. Being able to go forward with the case procedurally is a critical element when it comes to elder abuse cases. This is particularly true because deadlines do apply and there are statutes of limitation. For that reason, it is important to talk to an elder abuse attorney who understands these processes.</h5>

				<h1 class="main_header">Why Do We Defend the Elderly?</h1>
				<h5 class="heading_description">We do what some have called “Elder Law,” but what does that really entail? Most people know that includes traditional aspects such as drafting wills, creating trusts, and any kind of estate planning in general. But unfortunately one thing we have learned is that the elderly amongst us are certainly some of the most vulnerable, and so part of our practice dedicated to helping them does include seeking justice on their behalf if they have been wronged or injured in some way. Our diverse litigation background and our detailed knowledge and experience with elder law issues puts us in a position to be able to prosecute these cases strongly. </h5>

			<!-- <h1 class="content_heading">What Are The Types Of Power Of Attorney?</h1>
			<div class="witnesses_section">
				<div class="qualifications">
					<h5 class="mini_content">There are many different types of powers of attorney and various names and titles used to describe each particular type of power of attorney, however it is important to note Louisiana law only recognizes two (2) actual categories of powers of attorney:</h5>
					<ol class="witness_qualifications">
						<li><h5><b>General Power of Attorney</b> - A general power of attorney grants all the ordinary powers of administration, this would include all authority to handle and execute the principal’s affairs, including but not limited to opening and withdrawing accounts, signing documents, alienating, acquiring, encumbering, or leasing property (which requires express consent), and all other other general affairs.</h5></li>
						<li class="internal_list_item"><h5><b>Special Power of Attorney</b> - A special power of attorney grants special powers, such as making inter vivos donations, accepting or renouncing a succession, contracting a loan, entering into a compromise, contracting or granting authority to execute a particular financial transaction or sale, or making healthcare decisions, such as surgery, medical expenses, nursing home residency, and medication.</h5></li>
					</ol>
					<h5 class="mini_content">Within these two categories of powers of attorney there are designated types of powers of attorney which operate differently.  A nonexclusive list (terms more commonly referred in common law jurisdictions outside of Louisiana) are: (1) Non-durable powers of attorney,  (2) durable powers of attorney, (3) special or limited powers of attorney, (4) medical powers of attorney, and (5) springing powers of attorney.</h5>
					<ol class="witness_qualifications">
						<li><h5>A <b>non-durable</b> power of attorney is one that is set for a specific time period, meaning the agent’s authority over the principal lasts for a set period of time.  For example an individual could grant a sibling (an agent) a special power of attorney to sell his or her home while out of the country.  The period of time would only last while the individual is out of the country and would be limited to a specific date and to a specific transaction, such as closing.</h5></li>
						<li class="internal_list_item"><h5>A <b>durable</b> power of attorney is one that upon taking effect lasts indefinitely or expires upon principal’s death.  For lack of better words it is durable (long lasting).  Often, an individual will execute a general power of attorney to a loved one which kicks in or takes effect upon the individual losing mental capacity (capacity of which is generally certified by two (2) physicians or the individual’s regular treating physician).  Upon certification by physician(s), the general power  last upon the principal reobtaining capacity or upon death.</h5></li>
						<li class="internal_list_item"><h5>A <b>springing</b> power of attorney is one that takes effect when a specific event or occurrence takes place.  For lack of better words, the power of attorney springs into place upon the an event.  For example an individual could create a special power of attorney that is a springing power of attorney that takes effect upon the individual leaves the country on a particular enumerated date.</h5></li>
						<li class="internal_list_item"><h5>A <b>medical</b> power of attorney is a special power of attorney (as defined above) which grants an agent authority to make all healthcare and medical decisions for the principal. It can be durable or spring into effect depending on how it is drafted and designated.</h5></li>

						<li><h5>Whenever the principal says so; OR</h5></li>
