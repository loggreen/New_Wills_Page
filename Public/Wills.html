			<div class="legacies_section">
				<h5>When you give someone property in your will, that is called a “legacy.” The person who receives that legacy is called a “legatee.” Legacies given to more than one person in equal shares are joint legacies. Legacies to more than one person, but assigned in distinct shares, are separate legacies. There are three types of legacies that you can leave to someone. A universal legacy gifts the entire estate, or what’s left after specific legacies have been made. It can be made to one person or jointly to several people. A general legacy is a gift of a percentage or certain proportion of the estate. A particular legacy is anything that is not universal or general, and is usually specific things being given to a person or people.</h5>

				<ul class="lapsing_list">
						<li class="lapsing_item"><h5>The person to receive property dies before whoever wrote the will.</h5></li>

		<h1 class="content_heading">When an heir's property is split by the other heirs: accretion</h1>
			<div class="accretion_section">
				<h5>Accretion takes place when a legacy lapses, a process by which someone else receives the legacy. The will can specificy how accretion will take place. Generally speaking anything not covered by the will is going to be distributed to the universal legatees in equal shares.</h5>
			</div>

		<div class="extinguishing_section">
			<h1 class="extinguishing_header">When parts of a will no longer have any effect: extinguishing</h1>
			<h5> Under certain circumstances, a legacy can be “extinguished,” which means it no longer has any effect. A legacy is extinguished to the extent that it involves property that is lost or destroyed before the death of the testator. A legacy of a certain object is not extinguished when the object has been transformed into a similar object without an act of the testator.</h5>
		</div>

		<div class="revocation_section">
			<h1 class="revocation_header">Can I cancel my will or change parts of it? Yes you can: revocation</h1>
			<h5 class="whole_revocation">You can revoke an entire will if you do any of the following: (1) Physically destroy the will, or tell someone else to do it; (2) Declare the will to be revoked with a signed and notarized writing; and (3) Identify and clearly revoke the will by a writing that is entirely written and signed by the testator in your own handwriting. Then simply sign and date at the end.</h5>
			<h5 class="partial_revocation">You can revoke just a part of a will if you do any of the following: (1) Declare the part to be revoked in handwriting signed and dated at the end, or in a writing signed, dated and notarized with 2 witnesses and signed on each page; (2) Make a later incompatible provision in another will. For example giving a car to one person and then giving it to another later; (3)  Give the thing away while you are still alive; (4) Revoke the legacy in the actual original will by writing on it and then signing it; and (5) If you leave something to your "current spouse" in a will and then divorce from them later. This happens automatically unless the testator says otherwise. 
			</h5>
			<h5 class="revocation_fun_fact">Although it sounds overcomplicated, someone can even revoke a revocation and make the original provision have effect.</h5>

		<div class="general_rules">
			<h1 class="general_rules_headline">General rules to remember</h1>
			<h5>The language of a will always controls what will happen as long as it is clear.</h5>
			<h5>When a will contains contradictory provisions, like giving the same car to two different people, the part written last will take priority.</h5>
			<h5>If you owe someone money and leave them something in your will, the legacy to them does not go to paying off the debt unless you specifically say it should.</h5>
			<h5>All legacies, whether particular, general, or universal, include the fruits and products attributable to the object of the legacy from the date of death. Fruits and products are things like rent from a property, or interest earned from an investment account.</h5>
			<h5>Specific gifts in a will take priority over more general parts.</h5>
			<h5>Any portion or part of the estate not disposed of under any of these rules or in the will is distributed by the rules of intestacy.</h5>

			<h1 class="content_heading">What happens if I don't write a will?</h1>	
			<h5>If somebody dies without a will, then their property is distributed according to automatic Louisiana laws. The process has very strict and sometimes complex rules.
